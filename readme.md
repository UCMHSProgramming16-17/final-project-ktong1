Notes:
I couldn't figure out how to make the combined scatter graph in energychart.html not reversed.

Structure:
    1. csvdata.py, finds data, creates energydata.csv
    2. energydata.csv, stores data
    3. barchart_INSERT ENERGY TYPE.py, create bar charts of the various energy types
    4. scatter_INSERT ENERGY TYPE.py, create scatter chart of the various energy types
    5. finalchart.py, create a scatter chart comparison
